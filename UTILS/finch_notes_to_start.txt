Generate a key:
openssl rand -base64 42

you MUST use the following command to remove ALL data if you restart the build process or set a secret key:
finch compose down -v 

Remember to 
create requirements-local.txt in the docker folder
change volumes
Add port 8888 for jupyter
remove examples from .env-non-dev file in docker folder
edit secret key in 
    .env-non-dev file (.env doesn't seem to work? gives a utf-8 error)
    superset_config.py (just add a SECRET_KEY='blah' line to this file) docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config.py, 
    config.py (this is where the env var is set or overriden by superset_config)
